# Deploying bank to internet

- Put image both in assets folder on Cocalc and Github
- Use "Manage bank" in the dashboard to "Build bank from cache"
  note \- need to do this carefully, tricky to rebuild the bank correctly \- first need to generate new seeds in the author outcomes then build bank from cache \(may need to do regenerated bank, not sure why it didn't work the first time\) update \- definitely need to regenerate bank in the manage bank
- Open `terminal.term`
- \(If needed\) Change Directory `cd math1090-spring-2023/`
- Run `git add -A`
- Run `git commit -m "update bank"`
- Run `git pull`
- Run `git push`
- If needed, use [CTRL]+[X] to dismiss merge screen or possibly [CMD]+[X] on a mac
